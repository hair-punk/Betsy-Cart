# Betsy Cart Module

My team was tasked with creating the backend infrastructure for a high traffic sales website, and I was tasked with designing and implementing the shopping cart module. 

## Usage

To install dependencies, run

```npm install``` 

Then install either postgres or cassandra in the package manager of your choice.

To seed postgres, run

```npm run seed-postgres```

To seed cassandra, run

```npm run seed-cassandra```

Refer to my [Engineering Journal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UxgsPrzfTyxeGCgR6D4nyP9PRomVU9cQ5k6bpTHEGA/edit?usp=sharing) for information regarding optimization and my performance test results/

To build the frontent, run

```npm run build```

To start the server, run

```npm run start```

It should be accessable from localhost:3006.
